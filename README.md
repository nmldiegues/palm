Portable Article Library Manager
============

This is a web-based application to manage scientific papers that compose the related work for some research work.

It provides:
 * upload and manage of documents
 * automatically fetches the references and citations
 * creates a graph among the who-cites-who
 * persists everything to a pluggable database (for instance, MySQL)

I have used this to manage my related work for my M.Sc. thesis.
